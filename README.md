## Introduction

Hockey Pool is a web application built with Next.js, Express.js, Prisma, Redis and PostgreSQL. It is a full stack application that allows users to create an account, join a pool, and make predictions on the outcomes of NHL tournaments. The application is deployed on Digital Ocean and Vercel can be found at [hockeypool.xyz](https://hockeypool.xyz).

Every night the application will fetch the latest NHL tournament games and update the database. The application will then calculate the points for each user based on their predictions and the actual outcomes of the games. The user with the most points at the end of the tournament wins the pool.
